for this project, the required thing to run is a gcc compiler
after installing,
use the command
gcc testbench.c

after compiled,
for linux execute with
./a.out
for windows execute with
a

this will produce the polar.dat file
which is actually a csv file with 4 column vectors


first column is the index and 
next three colums are values of three processess which is required to plot

take that csv and plot with whatever software the you have installed in your system
it may be python or matlab

but I have done it with gnuplot 
for that

run the command
gnuplot -persist graph.plt
